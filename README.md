# Housing Price Prediction
<h2>In this project, I train a LightGBM regressor model to predict sale prices of houses in the US within *$50,000* (MAE).</h2>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Training was based on 9 features: brokered_by (realtor ID), number of beds, number of baths, total acres of the property, city, state, zip code, house size, and days since the house was last sold.</p>

<h3>Applications of this model</h3>
<p>This model can help just about anyone living in the US â€” everyday Americans, real estate investors, market analysts, developers/builders...</p>
<p>The model is not only diverse in the number of people it can benefit, but also in the various ways it can be used! Citizens, for example, can use my model to find out how much a house should be worth in a particular area with specific room counts (e.g. how much a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom house should be in Orlando), how much their own house is worth, and can also be used to help them assess their home equity. The scope of who this model can help and the model's applications are extensive.</p>
